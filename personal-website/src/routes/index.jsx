+"My name is Hanzhang Zhu, and I usually go by Ivy. I grew up in Qingdao, China, and my family moved to Los Angeles shortly after I started studying Computer Science at University of Wisconsin - Madison. \n\n"
+"I've developed and deployed multiple full-stack projects to solve problems for myself, my clients, and different organizations and companies I previously worked for. I'm very passionate about designing and building software systems, facing intellectual challenges, and learning new technologies continuously to create innovative solutions. I genuinely enjoy this process of fast prototyping and then iterating to a more reliable, sustainable system that's ready to deliver.\n\n "
+"Outside of work, I enjoy biking, bouldering, archery, reading sci-fi, playing piano, and games that challenge me to think strategically. \n\n"
+"I'm currently in my senior year studying Computer Science at UW-Madison, and I am actively looking for research, projects, and work opportunities to discover my interests and contribute to exciting ideas. \n\n"
